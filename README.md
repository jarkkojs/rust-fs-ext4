# fs-ext4 — pure-Rust ext2/3/4 driver

Pure-Rust read/write driver for the ext2, ext3, and ext4 on-disk
formats. Mounts disk images and block devices, journals writes
through JBD2, replays the journal on dirty mounts, and exposes a
stable C ABI (`fs_ext4_*`) so any FFI host (Swift/C/C++/Go/…) can
link `libfs_ext4.a` and `#include "fs_ext4.h"`. MIT-licensed. Zero
kernel calls; zero non-MIT/BSD/Apache dependencies. Runtime crates
are `crc32c`, `bitflags`, `unicode-normalization` and `caseless`
(casefold), plus the sister `am-fs-core` block-device crate.

Designed for FFI: the C ABI is stable and the static library has no
host-specific assumptions, so the same `libfs_ext4.a` works equally
well in a macOS FSKit extension, a Linux FUSE binary, a Windows tool,
or any embedded environment with a `BlockDevice` shim.

## Status

Read/write driver for the common case across ext2, ext3, and ext4.
Mount + read is exhaustive against the ext4 feature matrix we test
against; write is journaled through JBD2 and crash-safe under
fault-injection sweeps for every multi-block op the driver
exposes. Specific gaps are listed under "What doesn't work" below.

- 700+ automated tests — 200+ lib unit tests and 450+ integration
  tests across ~100 test binaries (`cargo test --release`).
- All 15 multi-block write ops (`5.2.1`–`5.2.15` of the write-support
  plan) committed atomically through the JBD2 writer with explicit
  crash-safety sweeps.
- ext2 and ext3 RW are unlocked (Phase 9.1/9.2/Phase B) via the
  same flavor-aware extent/indirect dispatcher.

## Features

### Read

- Mount ext2 / ext3 / ext4 images and block devices (block sizes
  1 KiB, 2 KiB, 4 KiB).
- Inode parse with extra-fields support; `stat`, `readdir`,
  `readlink`, `read`, `getxattr`, `listxattr`.
- Extent trees (depth 0, depth 1, depth ≥ 2 read; uninitialized
  extents present as zero on read).
- Indirect-block trees (legacy ext2/3 — direct, indirect,
  double-indirect, triple-indirect).
- HTree directory traversal (legacy / `half_md4` / `tea` hash).
- Inline data (≤ 60 bytes inline file body, plus inline xattr
  overflow).
- External xattr blocks; ACL attributes (`system.posix_acl_*`).
- `metadata_csum` and `csum_seed` verification on every block that
  has an on-disk checksum (superblock, BGD, inode table, dir tail,
  extent tail, htree tail, xattr block, journal commit/descriptor
  blocks).
- JBD2 journal replay on mount: descriptor / commit / revoke
  blocks all honoured, including v2 (csum-tail) format.
- Read-only audit pass (`Filesystem::audit`) reconciles link
  counts and reports dangling directory entries.
- Optional LRU block cache (`CachingDevice`) for callback-mode
  hosts where every read hits a remote/RPC boundary.

### Write

All mutating ops route through the same multi-block transaction
buffer and commit atomically through `JournalWriter`:

- `chmod`, `chown`, `utimens`, in-inode `setxattr` / `removexattr`.
- `create`, `unlink`, `mkdir`, `rmdir`.
- `link` (in-place), `symlink` (inline + slow path), `rename`
  (POSIX semantics: `EEXIST` on no-clobber, `EINVAL` into own
  subtree, cross-parent `..` updates).
- `truncate` shrink and grow (sparse-grow leaves holes; reads
  return zeros).
- `setxattr` / `removexattr` on the external xattr block (alloc
  on first overflow, free when the block becomes empty).
- File replace (full-content overwrite via fresh extent allocation).
- `fallocate(KEEP_SIZE)`, `fallocate(PUNCH_HOLE)`,
  `fallocate(ZERO_RANGE)`.
- Extent-tree mutation: depth 0 → 1 promotion and depth-1 inserts.

Crash-safety guarantees: the four-fence JBD2 protocol
(journal-write → dirty-flag → final-write → clean-flag) is enforced
per transaction with an explicit flush between each fence. A
post-remount state is always either pre-op or post-op — never
torn. Pinned by parameterized fault-injection sweeps (see "Test
contract" below).

### Filesystem variants

| Variant | Read | Write |
|---|---|---|
| ext2 | done | done (indirect-block extents, no journal) |
| ext3 | done | done (indirect-block extents, JBD2) |
| ext4 | done | done (extent trees, JBD2) |

ext3 RW landed via Phase B's flavor-aware journal dispatch
(`jbd2::journal_block_to_physical` and `JournalWriter::open`
both branch on `EXTENTS_FL`). ext2 has no journal but otherwise
shares the same write helpers.

## What works

Per-operation, on a clean image:

- `mount` / `mount_rw` / `mount_with_callbacks` /
  `mount_rw_with_callbacks` / `mount_rw_with_callbacks_lazy`
  (lazy variant defers journal replay).
- `stat`, `readdir`, `readlink`, `read`.
- `getxattr`, `listxattr`, `setxattr` (in-inode + external block),
  `removexattr` (in-inode + external block).
- `chmod`, `chown`, `utimens`.
- `create`, `unlink`, `mkdir`, `rmdir`, `link`, `symlink`, `rename`.
- `truncate` (shrink and grow).
- `write` (replace-content; allocates fresh extents and frees old
  ones in one journaled transaction).
- `fallocate(KEEP_SIZE)`, `fallocate(PUNCH_HOLE)`,
  `fallocate(ZERO_RANGE)`.
- `audit` (read-only fsck — link counts, dangling entries).
- `fsck_run` (callback-mode audit exposed through the C ABI).
- `format_filesystem` (in-process `mkfs`; the C-ABI entry FFI hosts
  call to format a fresh volume is `fs_ext4_mkfs`).

## What doesn't work

Honest gap list — pulled from `docs/ext4-full-write-support.md`
and the in-tree TODOs:

- **Extent-tree depth ≥ 2 mutation.** Read works; write refuses
  with a structured error in `extent_mut.rs`. Phase 4 of the
  write-support plan covers the design (`docs/extent-tree-depth2-design.md`).
- **HTree internal split.** Leaf split is implemented; once a
  directory grows past the depth-1 leaf-block capacity (~340
  extents on 4 KiB blocks), further inserts return `ENOSPC`-shaped
  errors.
- **`extend_dir_and_add_entry` buffer-twin.** The fallback path
  used when an in-place dir-entry insert can't fit still does
  direct disk writes rather than going through `BlockBuffer`.
  Refactor pending (~150 LoC of `plan_promote_leaf` adaptation).
- **JBD2 journal modes.** The writer effectively runs `data=ordered`
  semantics today; `data=writeback` and `data=journal` are not
  selectable.
- **Orphan-list inserts on still-open unlink.** The driver
  doesn't see open-fd state today; the host (FSKit / FUSE) would
  need to plumb that through. Reads + replay of pre-existing
  orphan chains *is* implemented.
- **Casefold lookups.** The hash function is implemented in
  `casefold.rs`; HTree wiring is not.
- **fs-verity, fscrypt, project quota, user/group quota,
  online-resize, mmap shared writes** — not implemented.
- **EA refcount sharing on external xattr blocks** — single-owner
  only; never shares (deferred until a consumer needs it).
- **Indirect-path file replace is un-journaled.** The
  indirect-block replace helper writes data blocks directly. Only
  applies to ext2 mounts (which have no journal anyway) and
  ext3 mounts that disable the journal.

## Architecture

The driver is split into read modules, write modules, and the
JBD2 / transaction layer that ties them together.

- **`block_io`** — `BlockDevice` trait. File-backed and
  callback-backed implementations both live here; `CachingDevice`
  wraps either for LRU read caching.
- **`superblock`, `bgd`, `inode`, `features`** — on-disk parse +
  validate. All reject malformed geometry with structured errors;
  `cargo fuzz`-style harness in `tests/fuzz_smoke.rs` proves no
  panic on truncated / zeroed / bit-flipped inputs.
- **`extent.rs` vs `indirect.rs`** — the two ways an inode can
  map logical blocks. Read paths dispatch on `EXTENTS_FL`
  (`indirect::map_logical_any` / `extent::lookup`).
- **`extent_mut.rs`, `indirect_mut.rs`** — mutation planners.
  Compute "what the new tree would look like" without touching
  the device, then hand the planned writes to a `BlockBuffer`.
- **`BlockBuffer` (in `fs.rs`)** — accumulates bitmap, BGD, SB,
  inode-table, dir-block, xattr-block, and payload-data
  mutations for a single high-level op. `commit_block_buffer`
  routes the whole buffer through `JournalWriter` when a journal
  is present, falling back to direct writes when not.
- **`JournalWriter` (`journal_writer.rs`)** — owns the JBD2
  inode's extent map, allocates a fresh transaction slot,
  emits descriptor + data + commit blocks with the four-fence
  protocol, and rewrites the super-state to clean once the
  final-write phase completes.
- **`DeepReader`** — read-side helper that consults the
  in-flight transaction's pending writes before going to disk,
  so post-write reads inside the same transaction return the new
  data.
- **`verify.rs`** — structural verifier reconciling bitmap vs.
  inode-tree-claimed blocks; used both in tests and in the
  read-only audit FFI surface.
- **`capi.rs`** — C ABI. Thread-local error state with errno
  inference (`fs_ext4_last_error()`, `fs_ext4_last_errno()`);
  `catch_unwind` fence at every entry so a panic in the Rust
  interior never crosses the FFI boundary.

Deeper write-up of each phase lives in `docs/`:

- `docs/IMPROVEMENT-PLAN.md` — triaged stability / hardening backlog.
- `docs/ext4-full-write-support.md` — the 9-phase write-feature plan
  this README's roadmap mirrors.
- `docs/extent-tree-depth2-design.md` — the index-block split design
  for Phase 4.
- `docs/TEST-DISKS.md` — fixture / feature coverage matrix.

## Test contract

- **Lib unit tests:** across most modules
  (`alloc`, `bgd`, `block_cache`, `block_io`, `casefold`,
  `checksum`, `dir`, `extent`, `extent_mut`, `features`, `fs`,
  `hash`, `htree`, `htree_mut`, `indirect`, `indirect_mut`,
  `inline_data`, `inode`, `jbd2`, `journal_apply`,
  `journal_writer`, `mkfs`, `path`, `superblock`, `transaction`,
  `verify`, `xattr`, …).
- **Integration tests:** ~100 test binaries in `tests/`,
  covering every C ABI entry point, end-to-end mutation
  round-trips, journaled-path regressions, htree large-dir
  growth, ACL parse, large-dir HTree, deep-extent reads,
  multi-tier indirect maps, ext2/3 RW round-trips, fuzz smoke,
  fsck audit, orphan recovery, sparse-grow, fallocate variants,
  and the cross-validators below.
- **Crash-safety sweeps** (parameterized over 0..=N "drop the
  next write" budgets, asserting post-remount state is always
  either pre-op or post-op):
  - `journal_writer_crash_safety.rs` — `chmod` (0..=20 budget).
  - `journal_writer_crash_dir_ops.rs` — `create` /
    `mkdir` / `link` / `symlink`.
  - `journal_writer_crash_rename_write.rs` — `rename`,
    file-replace, external xattr.
  - `journal_writer_truncate_shrink.rs` — `truncate_shrink`
    (0..=30 budget).
  - `journal_writer_unlink_rmdir.rs` — `unlink` / `rmdir`
    (0..=40 budget).
  - `fallocate_crash_safety.rs` — KEEP_SIZE / PUNCH_HOLE /
    ZERO_RANGE.
  - `orphan_recovery_crash_safety.rs` — orphan replay budget sweep.
- **Cross-validators:** `tests/lwext4_cross_validate.rs` (BSD-2-Clause
  reference, opt-in via env flag — built as a library, never linked
  by default); a FreeBSD-VM cross-validator (`tests/vagrant/freebsd/`,
  `tests/qemu/`) is in flight.
- **Structural verifier:** `crate::verify::verify` reconciles
  the on-disk bitmap against every block claimed by the inode
  tree; pinned by `tests/verify_basic.rs`, also runnable as a
  post-mutation check from any integration test.

## Roadmap

Pulled from `docs/ext4-full-write-support.md` — items not yet
ticked. Numbering follows the plan doc.

- [ ] **3.5** EA refcount sharing on external xattr blocks.
- [ ] **4.1–4.6** Extent-tree depth ≥ 2 mutation (index-block
      split, recursive descent, merge-on-shrink, index csum).
- [ ] **5.3.1–5.3.3** JBD2 journal modes (`data=ordered`
      explicit / `data=writeback` / `data=journal`).
- [ ] **6.3** Orphan-list insert on still-open unlink (gated on
      host fd-tracking).
- [ ] **6.4** Link-count audit auto-repair under a recovery
      transaction.
- [ ] **7.2** Checked arithmetic in remaining hot sites (rare in
      practice; cosmetic).
- [ ] **7.3** Full FFI input-validation sweep.
- [ ] **7.4** Richer `Error` variants (cosmetic; `Corrupt(&str)`
      carries enough context today).
- [ ] **8.2** Cross-call extent-lookup memoization.
- [ ] **8.4** Coalesce adjacent dirty blocks inside the
      `BlockBuffer`.
- [ ] **9.3** Casefold HTree wiring.
- [ ] **9.4** Project quota.
- [ ] **9.5** User/group disk quota.
- [ ] **9.6** fs-verity.
- [ ] **9.7** fscrypt v2.
- [ ] **9.8** Online resize.
- [ ] **9.9** mmap shared writes (host-integration dependent).
- [ ] `extend_dir_and_add_entry` buffer-twin (the last direct-disk-write
      helper inside the otherwise-buffered write path).

- [`lwext4`](https://github.com/gkostka/lwext4) — BSD-2-Clause.
  Used opt-in as a cross-validator (`tests/lwext4_cross_validate.rs`),
  never linked into the shipping binary.

Spec sources: kernel.org ext4 wiki documentation; Carrier, *File
System Forensic Analysis* (Addison-Wesley, 2005). The driver does
not derive from any GPL/LGPL/AGPL source.

## Building

Standard cargo:

```sh
cargo build --release
# produces target/release/libfs_ext4.a (static lib for FFI consumers)
#         + target/release/libfs_ext4.rlib
#         + target/release/mkfs_ext4 (the standalone formatter binary)
```

Cross-compile to a specific target the usual way:

```sh
cargo build --release --target aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu
cargo build --release --target x86_64-pc-windows-gnu
```

Platform-specific packaging (macOS `lipo` for a universal static
archive, an Xcode `.xcframework`, deb/rpm/Homebrew formulae)
belongs in the consuming project. `fs-ext4` itself stays portable
cargo — no platform-specific build scripts.

### Using from C

Link `libfs_ext4.a` and include `fs_ext4.h`:

```c
#include "fs_ext4.h"

fs_ext4_fs_t *fs = fs_ext4_mount("/path/to/disk.img");
if (!fs) {
    fprintf(stderr, "%s\n", fs_ext4_last_error());
    return 1;
}

fs_ext4_attr_t attr;
if (fs_ext4_stat(fs, "/hello.txt", &attr) == 0) {
    printf("size=%llu mode=%o\n", attr.size, attr.mode);
}

fs_ext4_umount(fs);
```

See `examples/capi_demo.rs` for the Rust-side equivalent.

### Using from Rust

```toml
[dependencies]
fs-ext4 = "0.3"
```

```rust
use fs_ext4::Filesystem;

let fs = Filesystem::mount("/path/to/disk.img")?;
let attrs = fs.stat("/hello.txt")?;
```

### Testing

```sh
cargo test --release
```

Integration tests use ext4 image fixtures under `test-disks/`.
Fixtures are gitignored — regenerate them with:

```sh
bash test-disks/build-ext4-feature-images.sh
```

The generator runs standard formatter tools inside a short-lived
Alpine Linux VM booted under `qemu-system-x86_64`, so the same
script works on macOS, Linux, and in CI (no Docker required).
First run downloads the Alpine virt ISO + kernel (~75 MB, cached
under `test-disks/.vm-cache/`).

### Git hooks

One-time setup per clone, so every commit runs the same
`cargo fmt --check` + `cargo clippy` checks CI does:

```sh
./scripts/install-hooks.sh
```

Bypass a single commit with `git commit --no-verify`.
